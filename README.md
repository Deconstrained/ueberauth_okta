# Überauth Okta
Okta strategy for Überauth

## Goals
This is just the start `ueberauth_okta` strategy for support with Okta auth protocols. Initially, I will mainly be focused on Okta OAuth, but once that is up I will move onto other autentication routes I'd also like to support (see below):

- [ ] OAuth 2.0
- [ ] OpenID
- [ ] SAML
